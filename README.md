# FluidNet
 1) Developed a deep learning model using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the 2D incompressible
 Navier-Stokes equations for the lid-driven cavity flow problem.
 2) Implemented automatic differentiation via PyTorch to enforce governing PDEs, boundary conditions, and
 incompressibility directly within the loss function.
 3) Visualized complex flow behavior through velocity contours, pressure fields, vorticity, and streamlines, validating results
 against benchmark literature.
